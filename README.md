## Sales Data Model
End to end data model for a sales and retail firm. The firm uses a tailored CRM system
to track and manage all transactions. The resulting data in captured and stored in legacy storage system.
In this project, I design a data model that shall ensure that the firm's data is organized in a way that is efficient, accurate, and easy to manage.
The data model is implemented on postgresql DBMS running on docker.
